# Presentation

This assignment focused on data visualization. The dataset I chose to use for this assignment is the Dataset on Suicide Attacks (DSAT), a project hosted by the University of Chicagoâ€™s Project on Security and Threats (CPOST). I was interested in seeing what groups and countries conducted or had the most suicide attacks occur, and how certain world events (Global War on Terror, rise in ISIS and other groups, etc.) may have had an impact in the frequency of terrorist attacks. For each variable I examined, I used data wrangling skills to select the top 5 of each variable, and used my knowledge of visualization to make effective and visually appealing graphs and charts.


# Poster

The purpose of this assignment is to create a research project, incorporating data visualization and regression testing. I chose a dataset on perpetrators of terrorist attacks to see whether certain demographic characteristics were prominent among perpetrators. I also wanted to examine the role of online radicalization on young and unmarried men (since men made up the vast majority of perpetrators) and used a regression table to see whether online radizalization was a statistically signficiant factor. 


# Exemplary Code Chunk

This code chunk highlights my skills in data wrangling and visualization. I selected the five most used weapons in the data set and created a bar chart to show the popularity of each weapon. Second, I highlighted the use of each weapon by year by creating a line graph. Lastly, I used patchwork to put the two visuals together and adjusted the width and height so it's clearer in the presentation.
